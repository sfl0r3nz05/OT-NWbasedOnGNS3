# Adaptive Countermeasure based on Software-Defined Networking for Industrial Control Systems - Meeting notes for 25/11/2022

## Minutes

- This minute is created by [Ziyao Wang](ziyao.wang@se19.qmul.ac.uk).

## Closed issues and decisions

- [Santiago Figueroa](sfigueroa@ceit.es) created a bare metal EC2 instance (8 cores + 32GB RAM) with KVM support to host the GNS3 server and boost the simulation progress
- [Ziyao Wang](ziyao.wang@se19.qmul.ac.uk) tested OpenSwitchOPX-2.1.0+ to replace the deprecated OpenSwitch-0.4.0 image as a workaround of the access network [issue](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/OT-NWbasedOnGNS3/issues/1).

## Open issues and questions

1. Network deployment following control version strategy:
	- [Ziyao Wang](ziyao.wang@se19.qmul.ac.uk), [Santiago Figueroa](sfigueroa@ceit.es) and [Mikel Dean](mdeanoses@ceit.es) troubleshoot access network [issue](https://github.com/sfl0r3nz05/OT-NWbasedOnGNS3/issues/1).
	- [Ziyao Wang](ziyao.wang@se19.qmul.ac.uk) continues to deploy the distribution layer.

## Discussion and proposals

## Special note

- [Ziyao Wang](ziyao.wang@se19.qmul.ac.uk) found the original [blog](https://brezular.com/2017/09/07/enterprise-network-on-gns3-part-1-introduction/) on ICS network for the project.
- [Ziyao Wang](ziyao.wang@se19.qmul.ac.uk) launched Arista vEOS as local QEMU instance with a bootloader described in this [blog](https://brezular.com/2014/10/03/arista-veos-on-gns3/). He noted that simulation of Arista vEOS instance is resource-intensive and it takes over 20 minutes to launch it without KVM.
